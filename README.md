Bamboo - Code Exercise

Background

  Bamboo have decided to open an online bank, Bambank, with its own currency, Bambeuros.
  The new bank will run a promotion giving all new customers 100 free Bambeuros when they
  sign up.


Requirements

  We would like you to build a prototype web application that allows users to:
  - Create an account / log in
  - View their current balance and transactions
  - Send Bambeuros to other users
  
  
Due to time constraints the application does not provide full functionality. Currently, users can only sign up, sign in, 
sign out and view the balance that they have. 100 Bambeuros are added to each new user. Future functionality will
allow users to send Bambeuros to other users and view their transactions.
